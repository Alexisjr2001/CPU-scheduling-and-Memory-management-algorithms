# CPU-scheduling-and-Memory-management-algorithms

- Implementations of some **CPU scheduling** and **Memory management** algorithms in Java.

  - We have implemented scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SRTF (with preemption), and Round Robin (for any quantum value).
  - We have also implemented dynamic segmentation algorithms of memory such as Best Fit, Worst Fit, First Fit, and Next Fit.

- These implementations were developed as an assignment for the Course: **Operating Systems/Λειτουργικά Συστήματα**.
